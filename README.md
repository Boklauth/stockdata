# stockdata
Disclaimer: This entirety of the project is meant to be investment advice. I am not a professional investment advisor. This code is just for my programming practice. This Python code will get stock data using a company's ticker. It will get the monthly data and visualize its volatility each month using the spread (range) of the close values. The usefulness of this data is to see how COVID affected stock volatility in March or April. Also, short term investment can see how much they expect to gain and sell off before the price drops.  The period and ticker can be changed. Provided as an example is HD (Home Depot).
